# StockControlApp---Mini-
Basic Features
The application can buy and sell stocks. When a product is sold, the date, time, quantity sold, and price are recorded in a separate file in the Record transaction folder. When the app is opened, it can display the product that has low stock. The MMStock products can also be displayed on the Table.
Advance Features
The app includes a smart search filter that allows users to search by product code. A user-friendly product information form is also available for ADDING a new product to the BBStock. The user can also UPDATE any product by selecting it from the table and then clicking the Update button. A user can also DELETE an existing product from the stock. The programme is also clever in that it just integrates the MMStock product once and stores it under the BBStock.
